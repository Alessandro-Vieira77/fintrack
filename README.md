# Fintrack
## Description
I created FinTrack, an intuitive dashboard that helps users organize their financial lives. The tool allows users to record income, expenses, and investments, save and edit each transaction by date, and view their complete history in a simple and practical way.
The goal of the project is to provide clarity, autonomy, and financial control through a user-friendly interface designed to support better decision-making.
